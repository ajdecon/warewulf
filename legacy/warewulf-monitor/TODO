Todo:

   - Fix up cgi generator
   - update the CGI frontend to wwproxy/warewulfd
   - Better warnings/errors when warewulfd is unreachable

Done

   - wulfd init script should be smarter about where the master is
   - Seperate out monitoring code from warewulf proper
   - Make changes to tools so they work on a more general basis
   - Make new 3.0 development tree
