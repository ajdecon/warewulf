Warewulf Intel(R) Cluster Ready Initialization Scripts:

  The warewulf-icr package contains scripts, and other helper functions, to
make your VNFS image compliant with the Intel(R) Cluster Ready Specification.

wwinit OFED Module:

  The OFED wwinit module provided, will build and install OFED on the master 
node, create an IB network configuration, and install the built packages
into the provided chroot.

    KNOWN ISSUES

    1) If the lspci output for an InfiniBand device does *not* have 
'InfiniBand' in its output, the script will exit. Override this behavior with
the OFEDFORCE variable.

    2) If CHROOTDIR is not known, the script will not modify any chroot 
structure on the disk.


    ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

    OFEDFORCE :: Defining this variable will work around issue #1, and
force the OFED wwinit script to run, even if the lspci output does not
show any InfiniBand cards.

  CHROOTDIR :: Location of the chroot on disk that we are to modify

  EXAMPLE

  Example runs of the OFED wwinit module.

    1) Build/Install only on the head node ... no chroot structures are modified

    # wwinit ofed

    2) Build/Install, and use /var/chroots/centos-6 as the chroot

    # CHROOTDIR=/var/chroots/centos-6 wwinit ofed

    3) Force #2 to run

    # OFEDFORCE=1 CHROOTDIR=/var/chroots/centos-6 wwinit ofed

wwinit ICR Module:

    The ICR wwinit module provided, automates most of the steps required to
have an Intel(R) Cluster Ready compliant installation. The tasks performed 
are:
	
    a) Create a chroot based on the Linux* distribution running in the master 
    node. 

    b) Install the packages that include the libraries required by the Intel(R)
    Cluster Ready Specification.

    c) Install the Intel(R) Cluster Runtimes. The package path can be defined
     with the environment variable ICRT_FILE or will be searced at the /root 
     driectory. E.g: /root/intel_cluster_runtimes_3.4-1.tgz

    d) Install Intel(R) Cluster Checker. The package and the license files must
    be avilable and can be defined with CLCK_FILE and CLCK_LIC_FILE environment
    varialbes respectively. If not defined they will be seraced at the /root 
    directory: E.g: /root/l_clck_p_2.0p.009.tgz and /root/l_clck_com_cd.lic

    e) Install the Intel(R) LAN Drivers in the master node and in the chroot.
    The package path can be defined with the environment variable ILAND_FILE 
    or will be searced at the /root  driectory. 
    E.g: /root/intel-lan_linux_v17.2.zip

    f) Call the OFED wwinit module above explained.

    g) Install the Warewulf First Boot feature in the chroot. The package path 
    can be defined with the environment variable WWFIRSTBOOT_FILE or will be 
    searced at the /root  driectory. E.g: /root/warewulf-cluster-node-3.3.rpm

    h) Create VNFS and bootstrap images using the freshly created icr chroot and
    import them into Warewulf. 

    ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

    ICRT_FILE: define the path to the Intel(R) Cluster Runtimes package
